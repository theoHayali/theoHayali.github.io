<p>If all input is valid then calculate and display the student's final average according to the formula:</p>
<p>final average = (.5 * hwAvg) + (.2 * midExam) + (.2 * finalExam) + (.1 * participation)</p>
<p>in the output area, you will present the student's final average (rounded to an integer) and final letter grade using the following criteria:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A webpage that contains:</li>
            <li>The heading Student Grades</li>
            <li>a form with input boxes for Homework Average, Mid-Term Exam Score, Final Exam Score, and Participation -  as integers
            </li>
            <li>With a button for submitting the data and a button to clear the form and a div element to present final results and/or error message</li>
            <li>A script that:</li>
            <li>checks for valid input, i.e., that the input is between 0-100 and that, of course, the input are all numbers.</li>

                </li>
                <li>you will calculate the sum, the average, and the product of the three integers</li>
                <li>you will also calculate the smallest and the largest of the three integers typed</li>
